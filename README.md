Network Query Tool PHP script

As of May 21,2013, this package is now a RFSCMS module. It can work as standalone as well.

I didn't make this script, but it is really good.
Recently, I searched the web for the original to see of there were any updates but I couldn't find it.
I am making a repository to maintain it.
